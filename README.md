# 🏷️ Product Pricing Prediction – Amazon ML Challenge 2025

## 📘 Overview
This project was developed for the **Amazon ML Challenge 2025**.  
The objective is to predict the **price of a product** based on its **textual and visual attributes** such as title, description, and image.

## 📈 Evaluation Metric
**Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE):**
\[
\text{SMAPE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum \frac{|Pred - Actual|}{(|Pred| + |Actual|)/2}
\]

Lower SMAPE → Better performance.
